### PLEASE EXCUSE OUR DUST

We're finishing up a big overhaul of the libary which includes

* Closure compiler advanced mode support for drastically better minification over previous versions
* Flashy new automated builds and test using node.js and grunt

Check out our [contributing guide](https://github.com/zencoder/video-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for info on building a local version.

## About

Video.js was built to provide a fast and easy way to embed and work with video in a web page.
It was built from the ground up with the assumption that HTML5 is the future of web video, however it supports Flash equally well for older browsers and for advanced features not yet supported in HTML5.

Some of the focuses of Video.js are:

- Universal browser and device support
- Fast player loading
- Easily skinned (themed/chromed) using just CSS
- A JavaScript API for controlling the video that works consistently across video platforms (HTML5, Flash, and soon other players like youtube) as well as devices
