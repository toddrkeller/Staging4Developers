<h1>Video.js Documentation</h1>

The Video.js documentation is here to help you setup and use the player. These docs can be found and contributed to in the [Video.js library repository](https://github.com/zencoder/video-js/tree/master/docs).

## Getting Started

* [Setup](setup.md) - Check out the [5 second setup](http://videojs.com/#section5) if you're just getting started. The setup documentation gives a deeper view of the additional methods you can use to trigger the player setup.

* [Options](options.md) - There are a number of options that can be used to change how the player behaves, starting with the HTML5 media options like autoplay and preload, and expanding to Video.JS specific options.

* [Tracks](tracks.md) - Text Tracks are used to display subtitles and captions, and add a menu for navigating between chapters in a video.

## Customizing

* [API](api.md) - The Video.js API allows you to control the video through javascript or trigger event listeners, whether the video is playing through HTML5, flash, or another playback technology.

* [Skins](skins.md) - You can change the look of the player across playback technologies just by editing a CSS file. The skins documentation gives you a intro to how the HTML and CSS of the default skin is put together.

* [Tech](tech.md) - A 'playback technology' is the term we're using to represent HTML5 video, Flash, and other video plugins, as well as other players like the YouTube player. Basically anything that has a unique API to audio or video. Additional playback technologies can be added relatively easily.

* [Plugins](plugins.md) - You can package up interesting Video.js customizations and reuse them elsewhere. Find out how to build your own plugin or use one created by someone else.
